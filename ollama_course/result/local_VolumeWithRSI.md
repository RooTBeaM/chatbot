**Incorporating RSI into the Trading Bot**

1. **RSI Calculation**: Calculate the RSI for the current bar, using a time period of 14 bars.
2. **Volume-Based RSI Conditions**: Create conditions based on the RSI value:
	* Overbought: RSI > 70
	* Oversold: RSI < 30
3. **RSI-Triggered Orders**: Set up orders based on volume spikes at specific RSI levels.

**Updated Python Code**

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from talib import VR, RSI

# Define your data feed and broker API credentials
tickers = ['AAPL']
data_feed = yf.download(tickers, period='1d')

# Set up price zones
bullish_zone = 50 * data_feed['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean()
bearish_zone = 200 * data_feed['Close'].rolling(window=26).ewm().mean()

# Define volume profile parameters
volume_profile_interval = 10  # in bars

# Create a function to calculate VWAP, identify price zones, and check RSI conditions
def calc_vwap_and_rsi(data):
    vwap = VR(VR.VWAP, data['Close'], timeperiod=5)[0]
    bullish_zone_val = bullish_zone[-1]
    bearish_zone_val = bearish_zone[0]

    rsi_val = RSI(RSI.ROSCALIB, data['Close'].rolling(window=14).mean(), timeperiod=14)[0]

    # Identify volume spikes at SRLs
    volume_spikes = []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        if abs(data['Close'].iloc[i] - bullish_zone_val) < 5 * 
data_feed['Close'].rolling(window=volume_profile_interval).mean() and \
           abs(data['Close'].iloc[i] - bearish_zone_val) > 3 * 
data_feed['Close'].rolling(window=volume_profile_interval).mean():
            volume_spikes.append(i)

    # Check RSI conditions
    overbought_condition = rsi_val > 70
    oversold_condition = rsi_val < 30

    return vwap, bullish_zone_val, bearish_zone_val, volume_spikes, overbought_condition, oversold_condition

# Calculate VWAP, identify price zones, and check RSI conditions for the current bar
vwap, bullish_zone_val, bearish_zone_val, volume_spikes, overbought_condition, oversold_condition = 
calc_vwap_and_rsi(data_feed)

# Create an order based on the identified parameters
if vwap > bullish_zone_val and overbought_condition:
    # Buy order at VWAP with RSI confirmation
    print(f'Buy at VWAP: {vwap} with RSI confirmed')
elif vwap < bearish_zone_val and oversold_condition:
    # Sell order at VWAP with RSI confirmation
    print(f'Sell at VWAP: {vwap} with RSI confirmed')

# Execute trade using your broker API
```

**Additional Tips**

1. **Adjust RSI Parameters**: Experiment with different RSI time periods (e.g., 14, 21, or 28) to find the 
optimal value for your trading bot.
2. **Use Multiple Time Frames**: Consider using multiple time frames (e.g., 15-minute and 60-minute charts) 
to increase the reliability of your RSI-based trading decisions.

Remember that incorporating RSI into your trading bot requires careful consideration of its strengths and 
limitations. By fine-tuning your strategy, you can improve your bot's performance and increase its potential 
for success.
