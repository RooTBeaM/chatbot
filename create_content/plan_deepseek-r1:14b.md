Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to break down the user's request into manageable subtasks for a 3000-word guide on intermittent fasting snacks for women over 50. The user wants each subtask to correspond to one paragraph with specific main points and word counts.

First, I need to understand the scope of the topic. Intermittent fasting involves periods of eating and fasting, so the guide should cover various aspects of snacks within this framework. Since it's for women over 50, there might be considerations related to metabolism, health conditions, and dietary preferences that are more relevant to this demographic.

The user provided an example breakdown with 12 subtasks, each focusing on a different aspect of snacksâ€”like introduction, benefits, high-protein options, healthy fats, low-glycemic carbs, etc. Each paragraph has a main point and a word count ranging from 200 to 1000 words.

I should follow this structure but ensure that each subtask is clear and specific. I need to make sure that all aspects of snacks are covered comprehensively without overlapping too much between paragraphs. Also, the word counts should be reasonable so that each paragraph can delve into its topic in detail without being too brief or overly long.

Let me list out possible main points:

1. Introduction to intermittent fasting and the role of snacks
2. Benefits of healthy snacks during IF for women over 50
3. High-protein snack options
4. Healthy fats as snacks
5. Low-glycemic carbs for snacks
6. Fiber-rich snacks
7. Hydration tips with non-caloric beverages
8. Avoiding common pitfalls in snacking
9. Balancing macros for sustained energy
10. Incorporating superfoods into snacks
11. Sample snack ideas and recipes
12. Conclusion on the importance of mindful snacking

Now, I need to assign word counts to each. Since the total is 3000 words, and considering the example given had subtasks with varying lengths, I should aim for a similar distribution. Most paragraphs are around 400-600 words, but some can be longer if they cover more detailed topics like benefits or recipe ideas.

I also need to ensure that each main point is distinct and covers all necessary aspects without redundancy. For example, the introduction sets the stage, then each subsequent paragraph dives into a specific category of snacks, followed by tips on hydration, pitfalls, macro balance, superfoods, recipes, and finally a conclusion.

I should make sure that each subtask is actionable and provides enough detail for the writer to expand upon without being too vague. The user emphasized avoiding open-ended conclusions, so each paragraph should focus on its specific point without leading into broader discussions beyond the scope of the guide.

Finally, I'll structure each line as "Paragraph X - Main Point: [description] - Word Count: [number]" ensuring clarity and specificity.
