Okay, so I need to help break down a long-form writing instruction into multiple subtasks for each paragraph of the essay. The user provided a specific structure with main points and word counts for each paragraph. Let me go through their query step by step.

First, the user wants a 5000-word piece on HBO's WestWorld, covering plot, characters, themes, AI, robots, consciousness, and where the show might have gone if not cancelled. They provided an example with five subtasks, each guiding one paragraph.

I should start by identifying the main sections of the essay: Introduction, Plot and Characters, Themes, Tropes in AI/Robots, Future Seasons. Each section needs a detailed main point and word count.

The introduction should set the stage, so maybe 500 words on the show's premise, themes, and initial impression. Then, diving into plot and characters would be next, around 1000 words to cover each season's main arcs and key characters in depth.

Themes are crucial, so a paragraph of about 800 words discussing core themes like consciousness and identity. The AI/robots section should be detailed, perhaps 1200 words, exploring how the show handles these tropes and their implications.

Finally, speculating on future seasons, maybe 700 words analyzing potential plotlines and where the show might have gone creatively.

I need to ensure each paragraph is at least 200 words but not too long. Also, no open-ended conclusions, just focused paragraphs. I should make sure all parts of the instruction are covered without splitting subtasks too finely.

---

**Paragraph 1 - Main Point:**  
- **Describe the main point of the paragraph, in detail:** The introduction to WestWorld, its premise, and an overview of its central themes.  
- **Word Count:** 500 words

**Paragraph 2 - Main Point:**  
- **Describe the main point of the paragraph, in detail:** A detailed analysis of the plot arcs across multiple seasons, including key events and character developments.  
- **Word Count:** 1000 words  

---

**Paragraph 3 - Main Point:**  
- **Describe the main point of the paragraph, in detail:** An exploration of the show's core themes, such as consciousness, identity, and humanity.  
- **Word Count:** 800 words

**Paragraph 4 - Main Point:**  
- **Describe the main point of the paragraph, in detail:** A deep dive into the tropes related to AI, robots, and consciousness, including how these elements are portrayed in WestWorld.  
- **Word Count:** 1200 words

This structure ensures that each subtask is clear and specific while covering all aspects of the writing instruction.
